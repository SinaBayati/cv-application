# CV Application

This application is built as a part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application).

With this app you can create a CV/resume and save it as a PDF file. Fill out the form and then
if you're satisfied with the way your CV/resume looks, click on the "Save as PDF" button. When the
print popup shows up, choose "Save as PDF" from the "Destination" dropdown menu and hit "Save".
Choose your desired download destination and then click on "Save" button.

You can [see a live demo here](https://cv-application-iota-drab.vercel.app/).
